# Modelling-Madugital(Project from Habis Kerja's course)
Madugital is a company that sells honey online. One day, Madugital's CRM Manager wanted to know which customers had the greatest potential to buy their products based on their activities on the website, so that Madugital could contact these customers more quickly with the right treatment.

The Madugital company has a lead collection in the form of filled in forms from several customers who access their website through various marketing channels. From this data, there are some customers who buy the product and some who don't, this is recorded in the 'converted' column.
